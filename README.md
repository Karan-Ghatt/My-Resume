Resume Project

This is an online version of my resume, intended to both showcase my development skills and my resume. 

1.Original template built by Bootstrap - "resume" theme: https://startbootstrap.com/themes/resume/
2.Found GitHub user w/ repo of all required elements from template, forked their repo. 
3.Made a range of signifficant changes. 
4.Background atom elements made by styling Awesome Icons

This project was great fun, compleated over the course of a few days, it prvoided a nice resfresh on my HTML5 & CSS skills, along with some JS. 

I HOPE YOU LIKE!
